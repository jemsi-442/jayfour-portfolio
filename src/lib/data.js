  about: [
    "I specialize in backend systems engineering with strong focus on structured architecture, role-based access control, and secure API-driven workflows. My approach prioritizes long-term maintainability over short-term feature delivery.",
    "I design systems using clear separation of concerns, modular service layers, optimized database modeling, and authentication-centered business logic. Every system is built with scalability and resilience in mind.",
    "Working primarily in Linux environments, I emphasize backend performance optimization, structured validation pipelines, API security, and clean architecture principles aligned with production standards.",
